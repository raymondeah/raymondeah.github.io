        <p>
        Hi! My name is Raymond (Ray) Eah and I'm a junior at Northeastern University studying 
        Computer Science.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Currently, I'm at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a> as a Software Engineer Intern, working on microservices and DevOps
        for a SaaS-based project management application used in the construction and engineering industry.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Previously, I was at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/kostas/" target="_blank">Kostas Research Institute</a> as a Data Science Co-op, where I worked on
        an R&D project in the geospatial sector.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy skateboarding, cooking, and volleyball.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        I'm looking for internship opportunities for Winter 2023 and Summer 2023!
